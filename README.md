# ML-CW1

This repo contains my enhanced work on question 5 of the first coursework of Machine Learning (INFR10086).

The first time I worked on this question, I screwed it up and received poor marks on this question (13/30 pts). The main issue is that in question a), when implementing the logistic regression, I didn't randomly initialize the weight and bias term (this turns out to be quite essential), and the code for updating the bias term is incorrect (Goddamn!).
For question b), I misunderstood the covariance matrices $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ as variances (Rookie Error!). For question c), I got 1/3 pts, mainly because I had had shallow understanding on generative and discriminative models back then (honestly I wouldn't be confident to say I've fully understood them by now!) 

Now I got plenty of time to modify my code and sort out all issues! :3
