# ML-CW1

This repo contains my enhanced work on question 5 of the Machine Learning Coursework 1.

The first time I worked on this question, I screwed it up and received poor marks on this question (13/30 pts). The main issue is that in question a), when implementing the logistic regression, I didn't randomly initialize the weight and bias term, and the code for updating the bias term is incorrect. (Goddamn!)

Now I got plenty of time to modify my code and sort out all issues! :3
